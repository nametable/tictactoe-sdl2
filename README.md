A small TicTacToe game using SDL2

I wanted to do an exercise to learn more about AI and decision making. I decided to make a simple TicTacToe game.

## Compiling

The script Make.sh will compile the game. I have not made a Makefile for it yet.

## Dependencies
 * g++           -on linux use "sudo apt install g++" to install
 * libSDL2       -on linux use "sudo apt install libsdl2-dev" to install
